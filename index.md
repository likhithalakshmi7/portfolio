## A Note to the Curious Minds ✨

> “In data we trust, but with context we thrive.”

This portfolio is more than just code and charts. Each project here is a reflection of curiosity, creativity, and the drive to solve problems that matter.

The power of data lies not just in algorithms, but in storytelling, empathy, and human insight. Keep building, keep questioning, and keep learning. 🚀
